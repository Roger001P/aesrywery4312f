# This is our Pytorch implementation
## Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.9.0. The required packages are as follows:
- pytorch == 2.0.1
- numpy == 1.26.4
- scipy == 1.13.1
- sklearn == 0.6.0
- torch_scatter == 2.1.1
- networkx == 3.1
## Usage
The hyper-parameter search range and optimal settings have been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in utils/parser.py).
* Train and Test
